            <h2>Turning Geospatial Data into (Questionably) Beutiful Sounds</h2>
            <p> A personal project exploring the relationship between the fundamental Tobler's First Law of geospatial science and music. In this project, I wanted to see if turning the coordinates geographers are familar with and mapping them to midi files would produce beautiful sounds. The results are interesting, sometimes melodic, and often dischordant and horrifying, but it was a fun tool to create. I first created a script to utilize geopandas to turn the x-coordinate of a spatial point into the timing of a note, and the y-coordinate into the note being played. I added some visualisation tools, includng a world map that shows the note being played in real time, and some various instruments, or soundfonts, to listen to them with. I learned a lot about both spatial data and musical files, as well as many obscure libraries of Python and Javascript (including how hard it is to integrate them into a Conda based environment). </p>
            <p>The full sized web app can be found <a href="https://yahnjr.github.io/map2midi/">here</a>. </p>
            <p><b>Skills used:</b> Python, Javascript, web application building, libraries, front and back end (full-stack) development, self-led projects, UI/UX design </p>

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Ian Maher. I am a recent graduate of the GIS Certificate Program at Portland Community College. I studied Zoology at Oregon State University for my undergraduate degree. I am passionate about the outdoors and our natural environment. I have many hobbies including scuba diving, <a href="https://github.com/yahnjr">coding</a>, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/snailzorz">making music</a>, hiking, reading, and <a href="https://iformaher.wixsite.com/yahnkui">traveling</a>. I recently moved back into the United States after living abroad for several years and I am ready to begin a career as a GIS specialist. I love making maps and engaging with mapping projects in my free time. Mapping is a powerful tool for visualizing data and discovering patterns, as well as communicating messages effectively. I hope you enjoy some of the maps I have made. </p>
