            <h2>Oregon White Oaks in Lake Oswego</h2>
            <p>A mapping project undertaken in collaboration with the Oswego Lake Watershed Council, examining the Oregon white oaks in the area. A focus was placed on known oak trees that exist in neighborhoods and other green spaces that are not considered parts of continuous oak habitat, and the value they can provide local wildlife and ecology. As part of this project, several different analyses were carried out including establishing connective habitat zones, joining to tax lots to establish address locations for oak trees, habitat suitability surveys for potential unmapped oaks, and oak tree size classification. A web app and story map were created to allow the final products to be used by both members of the council and the public, along with a  Survey123 form  so more oak tree points could be added into the map in real time. </p>
            <p>The full sized web app can be found <a href="https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/627fd32d40084cbfb94ec5a87d42b6aa">here</a>. The story map, detailing the process and reasoning behind the project, can be found <a href="https://arcg.is/1zSniL1">here</a>. </p>
            <p><b>Skills used:</b> spatial analysis, supervised classification, ArcGIS Online and application building, MapBox, Survey123, Story Maps creation </p>

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Ian Maher. I am a recent graduate of the GIS Certificate Program at Portland Community College. I studied Zoology at Oregon State University for my undergraduate degree. I am passionate about the outdoors and our natural environment. I have many hobbies including scuba diving, <a href="https://github.com/yahnjr">coding</a>, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/snailzorz">making music</a>, hiking, reading, and <a href="https://iformaher.wixsite.com/yahnkui">traveling</a>. I recently moved back into the United States after living abroad for several years and I am ready to begin a career as a GIS specialist. I love making maps and engaging with mapping projects in my free time. Mapping is a powerful tool for visualizing data and discovering patterns, as well as communicating messages effectively. I hope you enjoy some of the maps I have made. </p>
