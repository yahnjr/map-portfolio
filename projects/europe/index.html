            <h2>European Security Alert Summary</h2>
            <p>In my work as a Global Intelligence Analyst with Swan Island Networks, I monitored real-time events as they occurred and produced reports on the details and severity of each occurrence. We watched for events of several major categories, including security related events, demonstrations, meteorological events, and traffic incidents. Using our database, I produced a summary poster to highlight some of the trends and major events that occurred in the period between November 2022 and April 2023 in the European region. I showed areas within the continent that received high coverage from our team, as well as breaking down what kinds of events were most prominent in each country. This map was presented to the head of the company for possible use in acquiring new clients.</p>

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Ian Maher. I am a recent graduate of the GIS Certificate Program at Portland Community College. I studied Zoology at Oregon State University for my undergraduate degree. I am passionate about the outdoors and our natural environment. I have many hobbies including scuba diving, <a href="https://github.com/yahnjr">coding</a>, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/snailzorz">making music</a>, hiking, reading, and <a href="https://iformaher.wixsite.com/yahnkui">traveling</a>. I recently moved back into the United States after living abroad for several years and I am ready to begin a career as a GIS specialist. I love making maps and engaging with mapping projects in my free time. Mapping is a powerful tool for visualizing data and discovering patterns, as well as communicating messages effectively. I hope you enjoy some of the maps I have made. </p>
