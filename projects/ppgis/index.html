            <h2>Application Development for Public Input</h2>
            <p>One of the crucial steps in large urban planning projects such as comprehensive plan updates is the soliciting and integration of public input. There are many ways to go about this- however, I wanted to develop a solution that was simple and easy for everyone to use. After teaching myself some basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript, I created a publicly available app to collect comments from interested members of the public. The basic idea behind this application was for it to be something lightweight that could be deployed anywhere, easily refitted to any jurisdiction, and allow the addition of comments organized into topics by simply double clicking on the map. I did not want a complex back-end, and this use of the ArcGIS API for Javascript allows secure data addition without access to any private data or the need for extra privileges. There is an additional script monitoring the incoming comments hourly for undesirable language.  The code for this application is viewable on <a href="https://github.com/yahnjr/">my Github.</a></p>
            <p><b>Skills used:</b> front-end development, Javascript, HTML, real-time data monitoring and quality assurance, app development, PPGIS (public participation GIS). </p>

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Ian Maher. I am a recent graduate of the GIS Certificate Program at Portland Community College. I studied Zoology at Oregon State University for my undergraduate degree. I am passionate about the outdoors and our natural environment. I have many hobbies including scuba diving, <a href="https://github.com/yahnjr">coding</a>, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/snailzorz">making music</a>, hiking, reading, and <a href="https://iformaher.wixsite.com/yahnkui">traveling</a>. I recently moved back into the United States after living abroad for several years and I am ready to begin a career as a GIS specialist. I love making maps and engaging with mapping projects in my free time. Mapping is a powerful tool for visualizing data and discovering patterns, as well as communicating messages effectively. I hope you enjoy some of the maps I have made. </p>
