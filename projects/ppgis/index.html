            <h2>Application Development for Public Input</h2>

                <b>Skills used:</b>
                <span id="skillsContainer"></span>
            </p>
            <p>A selection of public input applications developed for several urban planning projects. The impetus for these projects was the lack of user-friendly public comment collection appse, especially for non-GIS users. I offered to develope some applications on my own, learning a lot about Javascript development and web application deployment along the way.</p>
            <p><i>Note: all of the applications showcased here have been re-created in the town of Wewahitchka, FL. There is no relation between the data shown here, simply for display and functionality purposes, to this very real town. It is simply a single place to center everything for consistency, picked at random.</i></p>
            <p><a href="https://yahnjr.github.io/mlogs/ppgis/expansion" target="_blank"><b>Limits Expansion Application:</b></a> An application developed due to the lack of ready-to-use applications for offering comments on areas, instead of specific locations. Users can select an area, or group of taxlots, around the city limits to offer their preferred development type for the area. After submitting, they can view what others are saying.</p>
            <p><a href="https://yahnjr.github.io/mlogs/ppgis/doubleclick" target="_blank"><b>Double-click Comment Application</b></a> As simple as it gets- this application was designed to collect public input from a city where most of the users were less familiar with technology. We wanted an easy to understand mechanism to add data to a map- and so with just a double click, comments can be recorded.</p>
            <p><a href="https://yahnjr.github.io/mlogs/ppgis/xmaslights" target="_blank"><b>Christmas Lights Application</b></a> This application is more about style than substance- we wanted something to record locations for places people could go to see Christmas lights. I wanted to give it winter vibes to make it memorable. (Yes I know that the example being in Florida will never snow). </p>
            <p><a href="https://yahnjr.github.io/mlogs/ppgis/street-signs" target="_blank"><b>Street Sign Survey</b></a> This application was created to conduct a comprehensive survey of street signs and streetlights in within a municipality. In addition, it doubles as a comprehensive map of assets with detailed symbology. In addition, streetlights can be checked at night for lightbulb status.</p>
            <p><a href="https://yahnjr.github.io/mlogs/ppgis/report-management" target="_blank"><b>Public Report Management</b></a> One part of a possible pair of applications, this one sits on the city staff side and serves as a portal to view, manage, and develop reports about public requests for actions on public works issues.</p>
            <p><a href="https://yahnjr.github.io/mlogs/ppgis/data-editor" target="_blank"><b>Focused Data Editor</b></a> A focused application that allows for easy batch editing of data. By allowing users to input certain values for their editing input, they simply click features they want to apply it to. Includes an information and apply mode so data can be updated and explored with ease. </p>
