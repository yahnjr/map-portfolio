            <h2>Fauntastic Chiricahua Mountains</h2>
            <p>In the summer of 2016, I completed a three month internship at the Southwest Research Station, operated by the Smithsonian Museum, in the Chiricahua Mountains of southeastern Arizona. I found one of the most fascinating places I had ever been to. This mountain range, which juts suddenly out of the surrounding Sonoran Desert, creates a so-called "sky island" which attracts animals from several of the surrounding ecoregions together into one of the most biodiverse places in the contiguous United States. I decided to create a map to show just how special this place is, especially for avid birders for whom the spot is often near the top of their "must go" list. I wanted to experiment with different mapping software, and I chose QGIS to create this map as I am a supporter of their open-source model. The data used is compiled from confirmed species observations made on the iNaturalist platform, which is widely used by both visitors to and inhabitants of the mountains, many of whom are retired professors.</p>
            <p><b>Skills used:</b> QGIS, open sourced software, self-led project </p>

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Ian Maher. I am a recent graduate of the GIS Certificate Program at Portland Community College. I studied Zoology at Oregon State University for my undergraduate degree. I am passionate about the outdoors and our natural environment. I have many hobbies including scuba diving, <a href="https://github.com/yahnjr">coding</a>, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/snailzorz">making music</a>, hiking, reading, and <a href="https://iformaher.wixsite.com/yahnkui">traveling</a>. I recently moved back into the United States after living abroad for several years and I am ready to begin a career as a GIS specialist. I love making maps and engaging with mapping projects in my free time. Mapping is a powerful tool for visualizing data and discovering patterns, as well as communicating messages effectively. I hope you enjoy some of the maps I have made. </p>
